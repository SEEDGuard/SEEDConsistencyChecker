# SEEDConsistencyChecker

## Getting Started

### Play with a certain method? (`CMIF` for example)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SEEDGuard/SEEDConsistencyChecker.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the pre-trained weights from this location:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/124tuB-Txg1nfv6mp9oc8ZRg7UhzSjC_M/view?usp=sharing
   ```
4. Replace the pretrained_model_path variable with the pre-trained weights location in the below file:
   ```
   SEEDConsistencyChecker/core/CMIF/Utils/seed_checker.py
   ```

5. Run the file from `SEEDConsistencyChecker` directory:

   ```
   cd SEEDConsistencyChecker
   python main.py --method CMIF --input_dir 'path/to/input/folder/' --output_dir 'path/to/output/folder/'
   ```

   Output is stored in the `path/to/output/folder/` directory.

### To run the Testing script

Steps 1 and 2 will be the same.

3. Configure the input and output path in `testing.py`:

   ```
   input_dir = 'path/to/input/folder/'
   output_dir = 'path/to/output/folder/'
   ``` 

4. Run the testing script from `SEEDConsistencyChecker` directory:

   ```
   cd SEEDConsistencyChecker
   python test/CMIF/testing.py
   ```
### Using Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SEEDGuard/SEEDConsistencyChecker.git
   ```
2. Make sure you have Docker installed and started, follow if not [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

3. Navigate to the folder consisting of `Dockerfile`

4. Build Docker Image
   ```
   docker build --tag your-image-name  .
   ```
5. Run the Docker image inside container  
   Update your-image-name, your_method, dataset according to your configuration. For more info on available methods refer to our [Methods](https://github.com/SEEDGuard/SEEDUtils/blob/main/README.md) list provided in README
   ```
   -docker run -it your-image-name --method your_method --input_dir dataset/input/ --output_dir dataset/output/
   ```
   Example:
   
   ```
   docker build -t cmif:1.1 .
   
   docker run -it cmif:1.1
   ```
6. Application is up and running. Output is generated and you can see them in the test folder 
7. You can see the logs, files, status for the container on the Docker Desktop.
